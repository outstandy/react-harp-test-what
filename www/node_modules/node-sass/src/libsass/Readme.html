<p>LibSass is just a library, but if you want to RUN LibSass,
then go to <a href="https://github.com/sass/sassc">https://github.com/sass/sassc</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby">https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby</a> or
<a href="docs/implementations.md">find your local implementer</a>.</p>
<p>LibSass requires GCC 4.6+ or Clang/LLVM. If your OS is older, this version may not compile.</p>
<p>On Windows, you need MinGW with GCC 4.6+ or VS 2013 Update 4+. It is also possible to build LibSass with Clang/LLVM on Windows.</p>
<h2>About</h2><p>LibSass is a C/C++ port of the Sass CSS precompiler. The original version was written in Ruby, but this version is meant for efficiency and portability.</p>
<p>This library strives to be light, simple, and easy to build and integrate with a variety of platforms and languages.</p>
<h2>Developing</h2><p>As you may have noticed, the LibSass repo itself has
no executables and no tests. Oh noes! How can you develop???</p>
<p>Well, luckily, <a href="http://github.com/sass/sassc">SassC</a> is the official binary wrapper for
LibSass and is <em>always</em> kept in sync. SassC uses a git submodule
to include LibSass. When developing LibSass, its best to actually
check out SassC and develop in that directory with the SassC spec
and tests there.</p>
<p>We even run Travis tests for SassC!</p>
<h2>Tests</h2><p>Since LibSass is a pure library, tests are run through the <a href="https://github.com/sass/sass-spec">SassSpec</a> project using the <a href="http://github.com/sass/sassc">SassC</a> driver.</p>
<p>To run tests against LibSass while developing, you can run <code>./script/spec</code>. This will clone SassC and Sass-Spec under the project folder and then run the Sass-Spec test suite. You may want to update the clones to ensure you have the latest version.</p>
<h2>Library Usage</h2><p>While LibSass is a library primarily written in C++, it provides a simple
C interface which should be used by most implementers. LibSass does not do
much on its own without an implementer. This can be a command line tool, like
<a href="https://github.com/sass/sassc">sassc</a> or a <a href="docs/implementations.md">binding</a>
to your favorite programing language.</p>
<p>If you want to build or interface with LibSass, we recommend to check out the
documentation pages about <a href="docs/build.md">building LibSass</a> and
the <a href="docs/api-doc.md">C-API documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>About Sass</h2><p>Sass is a CSS pre-processor language to add on exciting, new,
awesome features to CSS. Sass was the first language of its kind
and by far the most mature and up to date codebase.</p>
<p>Sass was originally concieved of by the co-creator of this library,
Hampton Catlin (<a href="https://github.com/hcatlin">@hcatlin</a>). Most of the language has been the result of years
of work by Natalie Weizenbaum (<a href="https://github.com/nex3">@nex3</a>) and Chris Eppstein (<a href="https://github.com/chriseppstein">@chriseppstein</a>).</p>
<p>For more information about Sass itself, please visit <a href="http://sass-lang.com">http://sass-lang.com</a></p>
<p>Initial development of libsass by Aaron Leung and Hampton Catlin was supported by <a href="http://www.moovweb.com">Moovweb</a>.</p>
<h2>Licensing</h2><p>Our MIT license is designed to be as simple, and liberal as possible.</p>
<p>sass2scss was originally written by <a href="@mgreter">Marcel Greter</a>
and he happily agreed to have it merged into the project.</p><footer><div class="grid"><div class="row"><div class="grid-1-1"><p class="text off-white">This the footer</p></div></div></div></footer><script src="bundle.js"></script></body></html>
