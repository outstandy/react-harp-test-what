Issue triage is a fancy word for explaining how we deal with incoming issues and make sure that the right problems get worked on. The lifecycle of an issue goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Issue is reported by a user.</li>
<li>If the issue seems like a bug, then the &quot;bug&quot; tag is added.</li>
<li>If the reporting user didn&#39;t also create a spec test over at sass/sass-spec, the &quot;needs test&quot; tag is added.</li>
<li>Verify that Ruby Sass <em>does not</em> have the same bug. LibSass strives to be an exact replica of how Ruby Sass works. If it&#39;s an issue that neither project has solved, please close the ticket with the &quot;not in sass&quot; label.</li>
<li>The smallest possible breaking test is created in sass-spec. Cut away any extra information or non-breaking code until the core issue is made clear.</li>
<li>Again, verify that the expected output matches the latest Ruby Sass release. Do this by using your own tool OR by running ./sass-spec.rb in the spec folder and making sure that your test passes!</li>
<li>Create the test cases in sass-spec with the name spec/LibSass-todo-issues/issue_XXX/input.scss and expected_output.css where the XXX is the issue number here.</li>
<li>Commit that test to sass-spec, making sure to reference the issue in the comment message like &quot;Test to demonstrate sass/LibSass#XXX&quot;.</li>
<li>Once the spec test exists, remove the &quot;needs test&quot; tag and replace it with &quot;test written&quot;.</li>
<li>A C++ developer will then work on the issue and issue a pull request to fix the issue.</li>
<li>A core member verifies that the fix does actually fix the spec tests.</li>
<li>The fix is merged into the project.</li>
<li>The spec is moved from the LibSass-todo-issues folder into LibSass-closed-issues</li>
<li>The issue is closed</li>
<li>Have a soda pop or enjoyable beverage of your choice</li>
