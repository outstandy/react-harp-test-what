<ul>
<li>git</li>
<li>gcc/clang/llvm (Linux: build tools, Mac OS X: XCode w/ Command Line Tools)</li>
<li>ruby w/ bundler</li>
</ul>
<p>OS X:
First you&#39;ll need to install XCode which you can now get from the AppStore installed on your mac. After you download that and run it, then run this on the command line:</p>
<pre><code>xcode-select --install
</code></pre><h2>Cloning the Projects</h2><p>First, clone the project and then add a line to your <code>~/.bash_profile</code> that will let other programs know where the LibSass dev files are.</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:sass/libsass.git
cd libsass
echo &quot;export SASS_LIBSASS_PATH=$(pwd)&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre><p>Then, if you run the &quot;bootstrap&quot; script, it should clone all the other required projects.</p>
<pre><code>./script/bootstrap
</code></pre><p>You should now have a <code>sass-spec</code> and <code>sassc</code> folder within the libsass folder. Both of these are clones of their respective git projects. If you want to do a pull request, remember to work in those folders. For instance, if you want to add a test (see other documentation for how to do that), make sure to commit it to your <em>fork</em> of the sass-spec github project. Also, whenever you are running tests, make sure to <code>pull</code> from the origin! We want to make sure we are testing against the newest libsass, sassc, and sass-spec!</p>
<p>Now, try and see if you can build the project. We do that with the <code>make</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>make
</code></pre><p>At this point, if you get an error, something is most likely wrong with your compiler installation. Yikes. It&#39;s hard to cover how to fix this in an article. Feel free to open an issue and we&#39;ll try and help! But, remember, before you do that, googling the error message is your friend! Many problems are solved quickly that way.</p>
<h2>Running The Spec Against LibSass</h2><p>Then, to run the spec against LibSass, just run:</p>
<pre><code>./script/spec
</code></pre><p>If you get an error about <code>SASS_LIBSASS_PATH</code>, you may still need to set a variable pointing to the libsass folder, like this:</p>
<pre><code>export SASS_LIBSASS_PATH=/Users/you/path/libsass
</code></pre><p>...where the latter part is to the <code>libsass</code> directory you&#39;ve cloned. You can get this path by typing <code>pwd</code> in the Terminal</p>
<h2>Running the Spec Against Ruby Sass</h2><p>Go into the sass-spec folder that should have been cloned earlier with the &quot;bootstrap&quot; command. Run the following.</p>
<pre><code>bundle install
./sass-spec.rb
</code></pre><p>Voila! Now you are testing against Sass too!</p><footer><div class="grid"><div class="row"><div class="grid-1-1"><p class="text off-white">This the footer</p></div></div></div></footer><script src="bundle.js"></script></body></html>
