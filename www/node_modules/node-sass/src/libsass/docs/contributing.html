Thanks for even reading this page. If you&#39;re here, you&#39;re probably wondering what you can do to help make the LibSass project even more awesome. And, even having that feeling means you are awesome!</p>
<h2>I&#39;m a programmer</h2><p>Awesome! We need your help. The best thing to do is go find issues that are tagged with both &quot;bug&quot; and &quot;test written&quot;. We do spec driven development here and these issues have a test that&#39;s written already in the sass-spec project. Go find the test by going to sass-spec/spec/LibSass-todo-issues/issue_XXX/ where XXX is the issue number. Write the code, and compile, and then issue a pull request referencing the issue. We&#39;ll quickly verify it and get it merged in!</p>
<p>To get your dev environment setup, check out our article on <a href="setup-environment.md">Setup-Dev-Environment</a>.</p>
<h2>I&#39;m not a backend programmer</h2><p>COOL! We also need your help. Doing <a href="triage.md">Issue-Triage</a> is a big deal and something we need constant help with. That means helping to verify issues, write tests for them, and make sure they are getting fixed. It&#39;s being part of the smiling face of the project.</p>
<p>Also, we need help with the Sass-Spec project itself. Just people to organize, refactor, and understand the tests in there.</p>
<h2>I don&#39;t know what a computer is?</h2><p>Hmm.... well, it&#39;s the thing you are looking at right now. Ummm... check out training courses! Then, come back and join us!</p><footer><div class="grid"><div class="row"><div class="grid-1-1"><p class="text off-white">This the footer</p></div></div></div></footer><script src="bundle.js"></script></body></html>
