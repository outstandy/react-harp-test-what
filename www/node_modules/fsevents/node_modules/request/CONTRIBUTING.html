<p>The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Request and its packages, which are hosted in the <a href="https://github.com/request">Request Organization</a> on GitHub.
These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.</p>
<h2>Submitting an Issue</h2><ol>
<li>Provide a small self <strong>sufficient</strong> code example to <strong>reproduce</strong> the issue.</li>
<li>Run your test code using <a href="https://github.com/request/request-debug">request-debug</a> and copy/paste the results inside the issue.</li>
<li><p>You should <strong>always</strong> use fenced code blocks when submitting code examples or any other formatted output:</p>
<pre>
```js
put your javascript code here
```

```
put any other formatted output here,
like for example the one returned from using request-debug
```
</pre>

</li>
</ol>
<p>If the problem cannot be reliably reproduced, the issue will be marked as <code>Not enough info (see CONTRIBUTING.md)</code>.</p>
<p>If the problem is not related to request the issue will be marked as <code>Help (please use Stackoverflow)</code>.</p>
<h2>Submitting a Pull Request</h2><ol>
<li>In almost all of the cases your PR <strong>needs tests</strong>. Make sure you have any.</li>
<li>Run <code>npm test</code> locally. Fix any errors before pushing to GitHub.</li>
<li>After submitting the PR a build will be triggered on TravisCI. Wait for it to ends and make sure all jobs are passing.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Becoming a Contributor</h2><p>Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given
commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is
more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.</p>
<h2>Rules</h2><p>There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>No <code>--force</code> pushes</strong> or modifying the Git history in any way.</li>
<li><strong>Non-master branches</strong> ought to be used for ongoing work.</li>
<li><strong>Any</strong> change should be added through Pull Request.</li>
<li><strong>External API changes and significant modifications</strong> ought to be subject
to an <strong>internal pull-request</strong> to solicit feedback from other contributors.</li>
<li>Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are <em>encouraged</em> for any other
non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.</li>
<li>For significant changes wait a full 24 hours before merging so that active
contributors who are distributed throughout the world have a chance to weigh
in.</li>
<li>Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.</li>
<li>Run <code>npm test</code> locally before submitting your PR, to catch any easy to miss
style &amp; testing issues.  To diagnose test failures, there are two ways to
run a single test file:<ul>
<li><code>node_modules/.bin/taper tests/test-file.js</code> - run using the default
<a href="https://github.com/nylen/taper"><code>taper</code></a> test reporter.</li>
<li><code>node tests/test-file.js</code> - view the raw
<a href="https://testanything.org/">tap</a> output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Releases</h2><p>Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.</p>
<h2>Changes to this arrangement</h2><p>This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be
subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have
something valuable to add or change.</p><footer><div class="grid"><div class="row"><div class="grid-1-1"><p class="text off-white">This the footer</p></div></div></div></footer><script src="bundle.js"></script></body></html>
